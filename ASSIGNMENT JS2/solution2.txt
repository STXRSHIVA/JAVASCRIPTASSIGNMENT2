The comma operator in JavaScript allows multiple expressions to be grouped together into a single statement. 
It evaluates each expression from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost expression. 
While not as common as other operators, the comma operator can be useful in situations where multiple expressions need to be executed in sequence.

The syntax of the comma operator is as follows:

expression1, expression2, expression3, ..., expressionN;

Here, expression1 is evaluated first, followed by expression2, and so on. The entire expression evaluates to the value of expressionN. 
The individual expressions are separated by commas.

Here's a simple example illustrating the usage of the comma operator:

let x = 2, y = 5;

// Using the comma operator in a for loop
for (let i = 0, j = 10; i < 5; i++, j--) {
    console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
}

// Using the comma operator in a function call
function exampleFunction(a, b, c) {
    console.log(`a: ${a}, b: ${b}, c: ${c}`);
}

// Calling the function with the comma operator
exampleFunction(x++, y--, x + y);  // Outputs: a: 2, b: 5, c: 7

In the example:

In the for loop header, the comma operator is used to initialize and update multiple loop variables (i and j).
In the function call to exampleFunction, the comma operator is used to separate the arguments.
While the comma operator can be a concise way to combine expressions, it's important to use it judiciously, as it may make the code less readable if overused. 
In many cases, using separate statements for clarity is preferred, but the comma operator can be handy in specific situations where concise expression grouping is needed.
